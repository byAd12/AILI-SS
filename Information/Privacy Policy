This github informs you of our policies regarding the collection.
MiniBoy Team get your Discord data to get a safer place.

Information Collection and Use
The data we collect on Discord is stored in secure databases to prevent data loss. We collect:

- All servers that use our service must have a custom prefix, therefore we save the server id to identify the server with its respective prefix. 
  When the bot leaves the server this data is automatically deleted.
- The ids of the users are saved for the economy system to be able to identify each respective user with their coins, wins, level, xp. 
  This data is permanently stored in our databases, but someone can request to delete it.
- To prevent the abuse of our services we save the command that was executed, who executed it, where it was executed and when it was executed. 
  This data is kept for 15 days and then will be deleted.
- Configuration data, such as the anti link, welcome message or ticket system, the server and channel ids are saved for these services to work. 
  When the bot leaves these servers the data is automatically deleted.
